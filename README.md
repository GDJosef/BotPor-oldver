# What is this?
This is an archive of my old version of BotPor, a personal project of mine using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you would like to clone this for viewing the code, modifying, or plain using it for fun, you may do so here below.

# Using the bot

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (at least version 12.0.0, as discord.js requires it)
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)

## Running the bot

1. Clone this repo, either using the Download button above the file viewer on GitHub, or using git.
   * `git clone https://github.com/gdjosef/BotPor-oldver.git`
2. In `bot.js`, find the variable named `token` and replace the value with your token.
3. Run `node bot.js` and wait for all the commands to load in the console.
4. If you/I didn't mess things up, you should be up and running to use it.
