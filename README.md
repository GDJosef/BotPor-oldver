# What is this?
This is an archive of my old version of BotPor, a personal project of mine using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you would like to clone this for viewing the code, modifying, or plain using it for fun, you may do so here below.

## Important Note
This bot was coded in discord.js v11, meaning that this may not run in the future. It is highly recommended to use another bot (not like anyone is using this for anything other than archiving) that is updated to the latest version of discord.js (v13, at the time of writing).

# Using the bot

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (at least version 12.0.0, as discord.js requires it)
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)

## Running the bot

1. Clone this repo, either using the Download button above the file viewer on GitHub, or using git.
   * `git clone https://github.com/gdjosef/BotPor-oldver.git`
2. In `bot.js`, find the variable named `token` and replace the value with your token.
3. Run `npm install` to add all the dependencies in the `package.json` file.
4. Run `node bot.js` and wait for all the commands to load in the console.
5. If you/I didn't mess things up, you should be up and running to use it.
